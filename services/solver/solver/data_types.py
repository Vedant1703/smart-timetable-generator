"""Plain dataclasses for solver I/O — no SQLAlchemy dependency (NFR-19).

These are the types the solver's model.py and conflict_checker.py operate on.
The API service converts DB rows into these before calling the solver.

Phase 2 additions:
- BatchData: FR-4.1 — batches of a cohort scheduled independently for lab courses.
- batch_id on EligibilityData / AssignmentResult: identifies which batch (or None for
  whole-cohort courses) an assignment belongs to.
- lab_room_count on SolverInput: count of lab-type rooms for H10 check.
- Deferred: FR-4.2 (stable rotation patterns across weeks) — not in Phase 2 scope.
  Logged as explicit deferral to avoid silent gap.
