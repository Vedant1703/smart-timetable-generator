"""CP-SAT solver model — one builder function per H-code (§9.3).

Class Timetable Decision variable: assign[f, c, k, r, s] ∈ {0, 1}
  Staff f teaches course c to cohort k in room r at slot s.

Exam Timetable Decision variable (Phase 4): exam_assign[e, i, s] ∈ {0, 1}
  Exam session e is assigned invigilator i at slot s.
  - Fixed by pre-processing (not solver decisions): room, cohort, course, and exact student seating for the exam session.
  - CP-SAT decisions: Which slot `s` the exam session occurs in, and which invigilator `i` is assigned.

H5 (eligibility) and H9 (room type match) are enforced by construction —
variables are only created for valid (f,c,k) and (c,r) pairs.

H7 (valid period range) is enforced by construction — variables are only
created for slot indices present in the period_slots input.
